## Legal and Regulatory Analysis

### US Copyright Office AI Report (January 2025)

**Key Findings on AI-Generated Content:**

**1. Human Authorship Requirement**
- AI outputs can be protected by copyright only where a human author has determined sufficient expressive elements
- Existing copyright law principles are flexible enough to apply to AI technology
- Constitutional goals of copyright center on human creativity

**2. Situations Where Copyright Protection Applies**
- Human-authored work is perceptible in AI output
- Human makes creative arrangements or modifications of AI output
- AI assists in the process of creation (doesn't bar copyrightability)
- AI-generated material included in larger human-generated work

**3. Situations Where Copyright Protection Does NOT Apply**
- Mere provision of prompts to AI systems
- Material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine
- AI outputs based solely on text prompts (regardless of complexity)

**4. Policy Implications**
- No changes to existing copyright law are needed
- Extending protection to machine-determined content would undermine constitutional goals
- Focus remains on centrality of human creativity to copyright

**5. Prompt Marketplace Implications**
- Simple prompts alone cannot be copyrighted
- Complex prompt engineering may qualify if sufficient human creativity is demonstrated
- Prompt collections with human curation and organization may be protectable
- AI-generated outputs from prompts are not automatically copyrightable
- Human modification and arrangement of AI outputs can create copyrightable works
